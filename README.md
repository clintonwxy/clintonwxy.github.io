Welcome to the repositry for my personal blog where I maintain my data science projects! You can access the blog [here](https://clintonwxy.github.io/)! Presently, I am studying Quantitative Methods where I had and have been learning about various data science skills such as time series and natural language processing. 

My current focus is on the data sets availible on [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/), which I document on my blog, and have created an R package on. The package access the developer API tools and returns a data frame with the corresponding information, it can be accessed [here](https://github.com/clintonwxy/datagovsgR)
