With the development of the new Changi Jewel in Singapore recently, I was curious to find out where the tourists who visit Singapore come from. I turn
to the Overseas visitor survey, which contains information about tourists'accomodation, frequency of visit, purpose of visit and number of travelling
companions.

Unsurpisingly, the first time visitors coming to Singapore mostly are from Germany, France, USA, Canada and Italy. Also, repeat visitors mostly come from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong and New Zealand.

Mostly, first time visitors are in Singapore for Holiday and Leisure while repeat visitors are here for visiting. There appears to be a mixed group for business. Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong visitors frequent Singapore for business, but not for individuals from New Zealand and Indonesia. Most first time visitors in Singapore for business come from the USA and Italy.
