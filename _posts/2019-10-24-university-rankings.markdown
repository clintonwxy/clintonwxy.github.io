The data within contained the data of the five out of six of the autonomous universities in Singapore, of their graduate employment rates and basic monthly mean salary, between the years 2013 to 2017.

Across the five universities analysed, we find that SMU trails ahead in both employment rate (95%) and basic monthly mean salary ($3924). Overall, the employment rate averages around 90%, with the universities being very close by this measure. However, we see a greater difference in the mean basic salary between universities, with the biggest difference at $832 between SMU and SIT.

Observing the employment rates over time instead, we find that while SMU graduates have had the highest employment rate over the years, the trends over time have also been quite stable, as with NUS and NTU. We also observe that SUTD had the lowest employment rate in 2015, but shot up to second in the following years. In general, the rankings of universities by employment rates have been changing every year since 2015. On the other hand, looking at the mean basic salary between universities, we find a very similar and stable increase over time between universities, with the yearly rankings remaining identical.

Notes:

- Overall, the values found for the employment rates and mean basic salary are not to be taken to be the true values. As noted in the source, it is not representative of all graduates, but only for programmes where there were sufficient responses by students.
