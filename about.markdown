# About Me

Hi! This is my blog where I document my data dives. I am mainly interested in working with data related to all things Singapore, 
and data visualisations. I believe that data analytics is an emerging field in Singapore, but has lately become an overused buzzword
everywhere. Nonetheless, I do hope that my blog can showcase the capabilities of data in Singapore, and ultimately lead to a better
understanding of data for all. Do contact me for any projects related to the +65!

R and Rstudio is my main choice for cleaning and visualising data. While I have learnt Python before, the tidyverse (thanks Hadley) is 
something that I love too much to give up (and also the ardous journey of becoming proficient in pandas). Nonetheless, I do agree that Python is 
the language of choice for modelling, and possibly the future? Not today yet I guess.

P.S. the blog name `missdesc` is a tribute to the first R package that I had written as part of a class. Fortunately or unfortunately, it
has only one function - to print out a summary of missingness of a data set. Hopefully, one day I will write a package which can be hosted
on CRAN.
